## Overview

Machine learning is a powerful tool that allows computers to learn from data. In this repository, I explore traditional machine learning methods, which are foundational techniques in the field. These methods include decision trees, naive Bayes, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM). 

I aim to provide clear examples and explanations of how these algorithms work, along with practical applications. You can find the code, datasets, and visualizations that demonstrate the capabilities of these techniques.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers a range of topics, including:

- **Classification**: Learn how to categorize data into predefined classes.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Understand the performance of classification algorithms.
- **Data Analysis**: Explore data to find patterns and insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize data to communicate findings effectively.
- **Decision Trees**: Use tree-like models for decision-making.
- **Machine Learning**: Gain insights into the broader field of machine learning.
- **Naive Bayes**: Implement probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Python**: Write code in Python, a popular language for data science.
- **Random Forest**: Use ensemble methods for improved accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Classify data using hyperplanes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you need to clone it to your local machine. Use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zoubyr/traditional-machine-learning.git
```

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, you may need to install some libraries. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Downloading Releases

You can find the latest releases of this project [here](https://github.com/Zoubyr/traditional-machine-learning/releases). Download the necessary files and execute them to start exploring the examples.

## Usage

Once you have the repository set up, you can run the provided scripts. Each script contains comments explaining its functionality. For example, to run a decision tree classifier, navigate to the appropriate directory and execute:

```bash
python decision_tree_classifier.py
```

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different datasets.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of what you can do with this repository:

### 1. Decision Tree Classifier

This example demonstrates how to implement a decision tree classifier. The script loads a dataset, trains the model, and visualizes the decision boundaries.

### 2. Naive Bayes Classifier

This example shows how to use a naive Bayes classifier for text classification. The script preprocesses the data, trains the model, and evaluates its performance.

### 3. Random Forest Classifier

In this example, you'll learn how to implement a random forest classifier. The script compares the performance of the random forest with other classifiers.

### 4. Support Vector Machine

This example illustrates how to use SVM for classification tasks. The script visualizes the support vectors and decision boundaries.
